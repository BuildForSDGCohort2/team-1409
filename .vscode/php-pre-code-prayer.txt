//our dear php who art in binary,
hallowed be thy typesystem,
thy monoids come,
thy will be done on vscode as it is in phpstorm,
give us this day our daily recursion,
and forgive us of our sideeffects and infinite loops,
lead us not into imperative languages,
but deliver us from mutation,
for thine is thy type system the queries.
and the pure functions, forever and ever.
in the name of filter map and reduce
amen.
